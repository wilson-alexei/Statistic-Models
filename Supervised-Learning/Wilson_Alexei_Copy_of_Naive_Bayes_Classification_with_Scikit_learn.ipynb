        "- It is not only a simple approach but also a fast and accurate method for prediction.\n",
        "- Naive Bayes has very low computation cost.\n",
        "- It can efficiently work on a large dataset.\n",
        "- It performs well in case of discrete response variable compared to the continuous variable.\n",
        "- It can be used with multiple class prediction problems.\n",
        "- It also performs well in the case of text analytics problems.\n",
        "- When the assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compared to other models like logistic regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Disadvantages\n",
        "- The assumption of independent features. In practice, it is almost impossible that model will get a set of predictors which are entirely independent.\n",
        "- If there is no training tuple of a particular class, this causes zero posterior probability. In this case, the model is unable to make predictions. This problem is known as Zero Probability/Frequency Problem.\n",
