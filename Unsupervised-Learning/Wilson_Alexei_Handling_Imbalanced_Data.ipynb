Therefore, it is imperative to choose the evaluation metric of your model correctly. If it is not done, then you might end up adjusting/optimizing a useless parameter. In a real business-first scenario, this may lead to a complete waste.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are problems where a class imbalance is not just common; it is bound to happen. For example, the datasets that deal with fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, it is very likely that the number of fraudulent transactions as compares to the number of non-fraudulent transactions will be very much less. And this is where the problem arises. You will study why."

But in this case, taking any help from the majority class, you increase the instances corresponding to the minority class by replicating them up to a constant degree. In this case, you do not decrease the number of instances assigned to the majority class. Say, you have a dataset with `1000` instances where `980` instances correspond to the majority class, and the reaming `20` instances correspond to the minority class. Now you over-sample the dataset by replicating the `20` instances up to `20` times. As a result, after performing over-sampling the total number of instances in the minority class will be `400`.\n",

        "\n",
        "A simple way to create synthetic samples is to sample the attributes from instances in the minority class randomly.\n",

It was proposed in 2002, and you can take a look at the [original SMOTE paper](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/%22http://www.jair.org/papers/paper953.html%22). Following info-graphic will give you a fair idea about the synthetic samples:\n",

        "\n",
        "SMOTE is an oversampling method which creates “synthetic” example rather than oversampling by replacements. The minority class is **over-sampled** by taking each minority class sample and introducing synthetic examples along the line segments joining any/all of the k minority class nearest neighbors. Depending upon the amount of over-sampling required, neighbors from the k nearest neighbors are randomly chosen.\n",

        "\n",
        "**NOTE**: In other words, instead of **copying** instances in the minority class, new instances **similar to** the original instances are generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The heart of SMOTE is the construction of the minority classes. The intuition behind the construction algorithm is simple. You have already studied that oversampling causes overfitting, and because of repeated instances, the decision boundary gets tightened. What if you could generate similar samples instead of repeating them? In the original SMOTE paper (linked above) it has been shown that to a machine learning algorithm, these newly constructed instances are not exact copies, and thus it softens the decision boundary and thereby helping the algorithm to approximate the hypothesis more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are some advantages and disadvantages of SMOTE -\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Advantages -\n",
        "\n",
        "- Alleviates overfitting caused by random oversampling as synthetic examples are generated rather than replication of instances.\n",
        "- No loss of information.\n",
        "- It's simple to implement and interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Disadvantages -\n",
        "\n",
        "- While generating synthetic examples, SMOTE does not take into consideration neighboring examples can be from other classes. This can increase the overlapping of classes and can introduce additional noise.\n",
        "- SMOTE is not very practical for high dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some variants of SMOTE such as safe-level SMOTE, border-line SMOTE, OSSLDDD-SMOTE, etc. If you want to use SMOTE and its other variants you can check the scikit-learn-contrib module as mentioned before. If you want to learn more about SMOTE, you should check [this](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sci2s.ugr.es/keel/keel-dataset/pdfs/2005-Han-LNCS.pdf) and [this](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-01307-2_43) papers.\n",

        "So far, you got yourself introduced to the concept of imbalanced data and the kind of problem it creates while designing and developing machine learning models. You also saw several reasons as to why it is crucial to tackle imbalanced data. After that, you studied different approaches that can help you to handle imbalanced datasets effectively. Processing imbalanced data is an active area of research, and it can open new horizons for you to consider new research problems.\n",
